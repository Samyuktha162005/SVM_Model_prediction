ðŸ§  SVM Model Prediction â€“ Machine Learning Project
This repository demonstrates how to implement and evaluate a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model for classification tasks using Python and scikit-learn.

ðŸ“Œ Highlights
1. Data loading and preprocessing
2. Building an SVM classifier
3. Training and prediction
4. Accuracy and performance evaluation

ðŸ”§ Requirements
Install the required Python libraries:
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn

ðŸš€ How to Run
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/SVM_Model_prediction.git
cd SVM_Model_prediction

Launch the Jupyter Notebook:
jupyter notebook SVM_Model_prediction.ipynb

Follow the steps in the notebook to:

1. Load dataset
2. Train the SVM model
3. Make predictions
4. Evaluate the model's performance
